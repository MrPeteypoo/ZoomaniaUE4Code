During my final year the programmers, artists, designers and animators came together to form teams of ten members. Our task was to make any game we wanted, my team chose to create a simple, competitive sports game where players simply have to score more goals than the other side.

Players have control over a character which could be changed at will in the style of Mega Man. Two characters exist, Charlene the cheetah and Gamba the gorilla. Charlene is fast, nimble and can dive and perform a fast goal-targeted shot. Gamba is big, slow and can deflect and throw the ball in any direction they want. Both characters have the ability to perform a freely-aimed slow shot, a goal-targeted straight shot and a goal-targeted curve shot which the player can control the curvature for.

The game was built using Unreal Engine 4.12.5 and it was the first time many team members had worked with programmers to build a prototype game. Although there was another programmer, I ended up writing the entire C++ code base and either designed, developed or helped with the production of most of the blueprints used in the game. I was also in charge of maintaining the git repository and I worked closely with the majority of the team, especially the animator, to ensure peoples interaction with the code/blueprints was simple and painless.

I ended up receiving a grade of 80% for my contribution to the game and the overall grade of the prototype we produced as a team. I'd hoped to achieve higher but there's a few bugs which slipped through the cracks as we only done a limited amount of playtesting.

I'm only open-sourcing the C++ code because it's the part of the game which I exclusively wrote. Although I exclusively wrote some blueprints I've chosen not to open source them as a lot of people edited a lot of different blueprints so determining exactly what I wrote is difficult.
